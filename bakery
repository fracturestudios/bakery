# TODO
# - Learn how python extensions work
#   http://docs.python.org/2/extending/index.html
#   Looks like the ctypes module could be useful for interop
# - Container object for intermediate asset objects
#   (wraps C++ data, provides type safety)
# - Container object for build chain items
# - Figure out how we're going to search for and load extensions
# - Figure out how we're going to specify build chains (Bakefiles?)
# - Documentation for building extensions
# - Build a couple of dummy core extensions
# - Load build chain
# - Validate build chain
# - Load extensions for build chain
# - Generate assets
# - Generate source files for loading the assets
# - Figure out how to set up python packages
# - Setup stuff
# - Setup instructions
# - List of core extensions
# - Core extensions

# Extensions
# TODO this belongs in a standalone doc eventually
# Looks like what we can do is
# - Look through predefined search paths
#   (make this easy to configure in the source itself.
#    By default, look in bakery/ext/, i.e. bakery.ext)
# - For each package in bakery.ext, dir() it and check if it has a bakery
#   module
# - If it does, imp.load_module() the bakery module and add it to some global
#   extensions list
#
