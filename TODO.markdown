## build-bakery

* Change repo layout a bit
    * buildsrc/ -> build/
    * bin/build-bakery -> build/build-bakery
    * That way bin only contains bake (i.e. things that belong in $INSTALL/bin).
* Generate a makefile
    * Builds all of bakery's source files / headers
    * Builds all found plugin source files / headers
    * clean should remove all the .o and autogenerated files from src/,
      plugins/, bakesrc/, buildsrc/
    * distclean should additionally delete libs, binaries, and build system

## Later
