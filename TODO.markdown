## build-bakery

* Generate a makefile
    * Builds all of bakery's source files / headers
    * Builds all found plugin source files / headers
    * clean should remove all the .o and autogenerated files from src/,
      plugins/, bakesrc/, buildsrc/
    * distclean should additionally delete libs, binaries, and build system
* Change header generation to include per-plugin headers
    * Changed my mind, don't like the uber-header idea anymore,
      especially if the build system needs to copy headers anyways
* Less verbose plugin output
    * Just display something like
        OrgName.PluginName vXYZ, 7 export(s)
    * Command line option to turn verbosity back on
* Display dependency list at the end of manifest scanning
    "Your offline pipeline has dependencies on the following libraries:"
        -lassimp -Lassimp -lboost
        -lavcodec
